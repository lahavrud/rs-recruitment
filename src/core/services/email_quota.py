"""Email quota tracking and alerting.

Maintains a daily counter in the ``email_quota`` table. After each successful
send the worker calls ``increment_and_alert``, which bumps today's row and
emits log warnings as the free-tier limits approach.

No hard enforcement is applied here — Resend's own 429 response is the
backstop. The goal is to surface usage before the ceiling is hit.
