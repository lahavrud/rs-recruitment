    Three flavors, dispatched by the (``candidate_user``, ``claim_password``)

    * Anonymous apply (no user, no password) — existing behavior.
    * Anonymous claim (no user, password supplied) — submit the application
      AND register a candidate User in the same request. Activation token is
      minted and emailed via the shared #605 helper. If the email is already
      taken by an active candidate user the apply is rejected upfront with
      ``EmailAlreadyExistsError`` and the password is irrelevant.
    * Logged-in candidate apply (user supplied) — use ``user.email`` instead
      of the form's email, snapshot the new resume on the Application,
      sync any updated identity fields onto the candidate's existing
      profile, and skip per-application consent writes (consent was already
      captured at activation time per #605).
