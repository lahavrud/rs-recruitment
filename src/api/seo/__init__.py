"""SEO endpoints package.

Public surface is the FastAPI ``router``; ``src.main`` registers it via
``app.include_router(seo.router)``. Internal modules split the implementation
to keep individual files under the project's 200-line cap.

The /api/og/* routes serve a server-rendered HTML version of public pages.
nginx routes traffic here for:
  - social-preview scrapers (LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, …) — they
    don't execute JS and need a fully-meta'd <head>.
  - search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Googlebot-Mobile, Bingbot) — Google
    does render JS but the second-stage queue is slow and unreliable; serving
    a fully-rendered HTML document gets us indexed faster and more
    completely, with the same JSON-LD the SPA emits.

Real browsers still fall through to the SPA.
