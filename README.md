# RS Recruitment

A full-stack recruitment CRM built for a boutique agency. Manages the full pipeline from company onboarding and job posting through candidate applications to admin-gated match decisions — with a dark luxury React frontend served over a production AWS stack.

## Features

**Public**
- Job board with per-job detail pages and JSON-LD `JobPosting` structured data
- Candidate application form with resume upload (PDF/DOCX → S3)
- GDPR-style consent tracking: timestamp, policy version, IP, user-agent stored per submission
- SEO: dynamic sitemap.xml, robots.txt, Open Graph meta, server-side prerendered OG pages

**Admin**
- Invite-based company onboarding (token → registration → approval → activation)
- Job approval queue (review, approve, or reject postings)
- Application management with status tracking (New → Approved → Hired/Rejected/Withdrawn)
- Candidate directory with profile and resume access
- Append-only audit log: every admin action is recorded with actor, target, IP, and timestamp

**Company**
- Job posting and management dashboard
- View applications per job

**Candidate**
- Self-registration with email verification (2-hour activation window)
- Profile management (name, phone, LinkedIn URL, resume upload)
- View submitted applications and their status
- GDPR data export (profile + per-application resumes as ZIP)
- Password reset (forgot-password → email link → reset flow)

**Auth**
- JWT access token (10 min) + HttpOnly refresh cookie (7 days)
- Role-based route guards (ADMIN / COMPANY / CANDIDATE / public)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-min cooldown, database-backed)
- Refresh token rotation: single-use tokens deleted on use, logout, or password reset

## Architecture

<img src="docs/screenshots/aws-architecture.png" width="750" alt="AWS architecture diagram" />

<p><em>Request path: Users → Cloudflare (DNS only) → CloudFront → S3 (frontend SPA) or EC2 via API/auth/health behaviors (Lambda@Edge handles bot detection for OG prerender). Background jobs: SQS → worker container. CI/CD path: GitHub Actions → S3 (frontend bundle) + ECR (Docker images) + SSM Run Command → EC2. Observability: CloudWatch alarms → SNS ops-alerts; Inspector2 scanning ECR images. All secrets live in SSM Parameter Store as SecureStrings.</em></p>

    Job ||--o{ Application : receives

## Design Decisions

**Three-tier authentication** — Admins, companies, and candidates are all full authenticated roles (ADMIN, COMPANY, CANDIDATE). Admins approve company invites; companies post jobs; candidates self-register, activate via email, and claim their applications. The schema distinguishes authenticated candidates (`user_id` linked) from anonymous leads (applications submitted before registration), enabling a seamless "register and claim" flow without breaking legacy data.

**Stateless JWT with short-lived access tokens** — Access tokens have a 10-minute TTL; refresh tokens are single-use and deleted from the database on logout or refresh. There is no blacklist — the short TTL serves as the post-logout tolerance window. Refresh token rotation (delete consumed token, issue new pair) prevents replays. Failed login attempts and account lockout are tracked on the `User` row with a `locked_until` timestamp.

**Storage and email abstraction** — Both file storage and email are behind provider interfaces. A single env var switches between local/S3 for storage with no code changes. Email providers can be SES or SMTP; production uses Resend via SMTP relay. This made local development cheap and production deployment straightforward.

**Async task queue with AWS SQS** — Sending email from inside a request handler risks timeouts and drops on provider throttling. All outbound email is pushed to an SQS queue and processed by a separate worker container (`src/worker.py`) with retry logic. Ten transactional email templates cover the full company and candidate lifecycle. The `defer_after_commit` pattern ensures tasks are enqueued only after the originating transaction commits, preventing phantom messages on rollback.

**OIDC-based CI/CD with change detection** — GitHub Actions authenticates to AWS via OIDC (no stored credentials). A `detect-changes` job skips irrelevant work — a docs-only PR never runs backend tests or builds Docker. The deploy workflow supports manual re-deploy by SHA, checks if an ECR image already exists before rebuilding, and polls SSM run-command status rather than fire-and-forget. Deployments are never cancelled mid-flight.

**Custom CI validation scripts** — Beyond Ruff and TypeScript, five custom scripts run in CI: SOC import enforcement (services must not import FastAPI), blocking I/O detection in async functions (catches `open()`, `requests.*`, `time.sleep()`), type hint coverage on public functions, test file existence checks (1:1 mapping with source files), and file size limits. Catches architecture drift that standard linters miss.

**Docker hardening** — Multi-stage build with layer caching on the lockfile. Runtime image runs as a non-root `appuser` (permissions fixed in entrypoint script). Dev and test dependencies are excluded. Health check hits the `/health` endpoint via the same proxy path a real client uses.

**SEO prerendering for a SPA** — Client-side React can't be indexed for job-specific pages. The backend generates server-side HTML snapshots with full Open Graph meta, canonical URLs, and JSON-LD `JobPosting` structured data (title, salary range, location, dates). A dynamic sitemap.xml lists all published jobs with `lastmod` from `updated_at`. Googlebot gets a real HTML response; users get the SPA.

**Hebrew-only RTL UI** — The entire frontend is in Hebrew with `<html dir="rtl">` forced globally. All UI strings live in per-namespace JSON files under `locales/he/` (13 files, one per feature area); raw backend error strings are never surfaced to the user.

## Testing

70+ test files, ~18k lines, parallel execution via `pytest-xdist` (each worker gets a dedicated database).

```
tests/
├── models/           # ORM model validation
├── services/         # Business logic (auth, admin, company, public, candidate flows)
├── api/              # Endpoint tests (SEO, rate limiting, request handling)
├── templates/        # Email template rendering
└── core/
    ├── services/     # Email, storage, file validation
    └── infrastructure/  # Database, config, security, transactions, rate limiting
```

Notable coverage: full auth lifecycle (invite → registration → approval → activation → login → lockout → logout), candidate registration and activation, SEO output (sitemap, JSON-LD, OG prerender), SQS task enqueue/handling (email, data export, candidate purge), storage abstraction, database transactions and rollback guarantees.

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto
```

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), Docker + Docker Compose, Node 18+

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/lahavrud/rs-recruitment.git
cd rs-recruitment
uv sync

# 2. Start services (PostgreSQL + Mailpit local SMTP)
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Run migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# 4. Start backend
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# 5. Start frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000`. Outbound email goes to [Mailpit](http://localhost:8025) — no provider account needed in development. Tasks (email, exports) run inline in the API process when `SQS_QUEUE_URL` is unset.

### Environment

```bash
# Minimum required
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")
```

Production env vars (AWS credentials, Sentry DSN, Resend SMTP credentials, S3 bucket) are only needed outside local dev — the defaults in `docker-compose.yml` cover everything for local work.

### Linting

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint
```
